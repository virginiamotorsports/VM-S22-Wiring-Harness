# VM-S22-Wiring-Harness
Wiring Harness for the 2022 Season's FSAE Car

## How to Use
0. If you're unfamiliar with using github, and the essential commands (push, pull, commit, etc) then please look up the basics!
    - Github's "Quick Start" guide: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world
2. Download KiCAD 6.0 and UP! 
    - KiCAD Download Page (Supports most OS): https://www.kicad.org/download/
3. Clone repository to your local machine
4. Open .kicad_pro file with KiCAD
5. Open .kicad_sch file within KiCAD
6. Have fun!

### Ground Rules
 1. Please commit/push your changes when you are done editing the wiring harness!
 2. Be mindful if multiple people are editing the wiring harness at the same time! It probably is tricky to merge them together by hand, although if components are creatively split up in multiple schematics then it may be fine
 3. There's probably more ground rules that I'm forgetting but those should keep y'all busy for now
